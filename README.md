<h1>Homexe Win</h1>

## What is Homexe Win?

Homexe Win is a software I designed for the Homexe Realty team at Cameron Prestige. The team had struggled with motivation in cold-calling and scheduling meetings, so they requested a tool that would do two things:

1. Track an agent's average number of calls and appointments
2. Extrapolate that data into an estimated commission-based income that the agent could expect if they continue at their current average.

Homexe Win displays this data as a trackable chart, allowing agents to monitor their progress.

## How Does it Work?

How do we track an agent's calls and appointments? As of right now, Homexe Win is built exclusively for the team at Homexe. This team uses the FollowUpBoss CRM to track agent activity, and we simply use their REST API to monitor that data ourselves.

## Can I Try It?

If you'd like to see what Homexe Win looks like, use the following credentials at <a href="https://homexe.win/login">homexe.win/login<a>:
